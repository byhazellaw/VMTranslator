# VMTranslator

Translates VM files into ASM files on the Hack computer.
For this project I decided to try a different coding style than the suggested implementation. Instead of handling input files inside one of the classes, the main method handles the inputs and utilizes different classes' methods to output the result. This is definitely uglier and not as clean but it makes debugging easier.
